The main backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this required part of the LaTeX system will probably not find the packages very useful. mathtools v1.01 2004/08/03 ========= The mathtools package provides many useful tools for mathematical typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes various deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It provides: -- Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows, harpoons, etc. -- Various symbols such as \coloneqq (:=). -- Easy creation of new tag forms. -- Showing only the referenced equations. -- Extensible arrows, harpoons and hookarrows. -- Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments for specifying the column alignment. -- More building blocks: multlined, cases-like environments, new gathered environments. -- Math versions of \makebox, \llap, \rlap etc. -- Cramped math styles. -- and more... mathtools requires mhsetup. empheq v2.11 2004/08/03 ====== The empheq package is a visual markup extension designed to function on top of amsmath. It features: -- Boxing multi line math displays while leaving equation numbers untouched at the margin. Any kind of box will do. -- Making the ntheorem package place end-of-theorem markers perfectly. -- Placing arbitrary material on either side of math displays. This includes delimiters that automatically scale to the correct size. empheq requires mathtools. empheq07 v0.7d 2004/07/27 ======== The obsolete version of the empheq package. It is incompatible with current empheq (and will continue to be so) and is only provided to make old documents work. mhsetup v1.0 2004/07/26 ======= The mhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by both empheq and mathtools. In the future, most of these tools will probably be an integral part of LaTeX3.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="248062">texmf\tex\latex\mh\breqn.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\cmbase.sym texmf\tex\latex\mh\empheq.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\flexisym.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\mathpazo.sym texmf\tex\latex\mh\mathptmx.sym texmf\tex\latex\mh\mathstyle.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\mathtools.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\mhsetup.sty texmf\tex\latex\mh\msabm.sym texmf\tex\latex\mh\xfrac.sty texmf\tpm\packages\mh.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="2530239">texmf\doc\latex\mh\breqn-technotes.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\breqn.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\empheq.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\flexisym.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\mathstyle.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\mathtools.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\mhsetup.pdf texmf\doc\latex\mh\README texmf\doc\latex\mh\xfrac.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="139649">texmf\source\mh-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1285065591</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3d828902c71a03c38f3d4f15e7635350</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
