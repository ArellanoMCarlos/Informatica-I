Each time a graphic is included, the eps file is scanned. If some tagged lines are found, they are used to define the psfrag replacements that should be performed automatically. Though a similar mechanism is implemented in psfrag, (legends of the form \tex[][]{}), psfragx offers much more flexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to define different replacements corresponding to different languages. The replacements to take into account will be selected on the basis of the current language of the document. In addition, a similar mechanism holds for overpic objects. These are picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. Everything can be performed automatically, though some intervention of the user is possible after the inclusion of the psfrag replacements coming from the EPS file and before the inclusion of the EPS file itself</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="15468">texmf\tex\latex\psfragx\psfragx.cfg texmf\tex\latex\psfragx\psfragx.sty texmf\tpm\packages\psfragx.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="196321">texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\Examples\psfragx_example.pdf texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\Examples\psfragx_example.tex texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\psfragx.pdf texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\readme.txt texmf\doc\latex\psfragx\readmePFX.txt</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="16988">texmf\source\psfragx-src.cab</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1104780293</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>e0bd154a604cc4e60728d3b256f8eed8</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
