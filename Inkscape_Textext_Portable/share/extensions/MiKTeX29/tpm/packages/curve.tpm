It provides a set of commands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe will then format the CV (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages, repeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful part of CV writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its ability to manage different CV "flavors" simultaneously. It is in fact often the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent versions of your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on different aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with support for AUC-TeX.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="21223">texmf\tex\latex\curve\curve.cls texmf\tpm\packages\curve.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="98769">texmf\doc\latex\curve\curve.dvi texmf\doc\latex\curve\cv.dvi texmf\doc\latex\curve\cv.tex texmf\doc\latex\curve\NEWS texmf\doc\latex\curve\README texmf\doc\latex\curve\rubric.tex</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="20416">texmf\source\curve-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1204043362</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>aee1d7b1aaec35db5c5f7e4bf328a78a</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
