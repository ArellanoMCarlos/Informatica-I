The mission of the Imprint is to promote a future in which funds currently spent on journal subscriptions are redirected to the dissemination of scholarship for free, via the Internet”. The journal used to accept manuscripts in Rich Text Format only. However, for many authors, especially from the field of logic, TeX seems to be a better choice. The author was commissioned to write a LaTeX class for the journal. 

The class helps authors to typeset their own articles in ‘Web-ready’ format. No assumption is made about the fonts available to the author: the class uses freely available and freely distributed fonts, only. 

The author is Boris Veytsman. The package is Copyright © 2007 Boris Veytsman.
