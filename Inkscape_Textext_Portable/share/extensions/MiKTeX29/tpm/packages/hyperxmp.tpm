The metadata is designed to be easy to extract, even by programs that are oblivious to the document's file format. Most of Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when saving files. Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. Hyperxmp integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as XMP: author, title, subject, keywords, copyright, and license URL. hyperxmp currently embeds XMP only within PDF documents but is compatible with pdflatex, latex+dvipdfm, and latex+dvips+ps2pdf.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="16122">texmf\tex\latex\hyperxmp\hyperxmp.sty texmf\tpm\packages\hyperxmp.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="117478">texmf\doc\latex\hyperxmp\hyperxmp.dvi texmf\doc\latex\hyperxmp\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="15006">texmf\source\hyperxmp-src.cab</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1148671285</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>68e9a5426f997a433036aa9cf8b3aa3e</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
